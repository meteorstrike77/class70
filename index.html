                Lego is ditching its iconic plastic blocks for a more eco-friendly material. After 85 years of production, Danish toymaker Lego have announced plans to make new pieces from plant-based plastic instead.In a bid to turn more eco-friendly, Lego have begun production on 25 various brick shapes that will resemble leaves, bushes and trees. Other sustainable shapes will also include the brushes in the car washes and street sweepers on the Lego City line - and dragon wings.

                In 2019, unprecedented wildfires destroyed thousands of square miles of Amazon rainforest, roughly the size of New Jersey. The loss of biodiversity and invaluable habitats, release of carbon from the fires, and other socioeconomic and environmental consequences have concerned scientists around the world.An international team led by researchers at Purdue University, the University of Lleida and the Forest Sciences Centre of Catalonia, both in Spain, used remote sensing platforms to understand the relationship between land cover and the 2019 fires. They reported in the journal Environmental Research Letters that the fires were mostly located in areas with substantial forest loss in the previous year.
